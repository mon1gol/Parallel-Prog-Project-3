A library for writing OpenMP-style parallel code in .NET.
Inspired by the fork-join paradigm of OpenMP, and attempts to replicate the OpenMP programming style as faithfully as possible, though breaking spec at times.

Prior users of OpenMP should find DotMP to be fairly intuitive, though there are some important differences.
